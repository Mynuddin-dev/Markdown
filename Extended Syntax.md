# **Extended Syntax**
---
### Tables
To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each columnâ€™s header, anduse pipes (|) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on either end of the table.

| Column1     | Column2        | Column3          |
| :---------- | :------------: |----------------: |
| Header      | Title          | This is 1st row  |
| Paragraph   | Text           | This is 2nd row  |
| Info        | Info           | Info             |
| Info        | Info           | Info             |

**Alignment**
You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the  ***left, right, or on both side*** of the hyphens within the header row.

To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).
