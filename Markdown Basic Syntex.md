## Break

I really like using Markdown.
I think I’ll use it from now on.
Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it.
Its syntax is very small,
corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags.\
In my opinion,&HTML tags are already easy to insert.\
The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a publishing format;
Markdown is a writing format. Thus, Markdown’s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.

## Bold
---
Two **underscore** or __astarisk__
**I love Bold text**
Why i cant Love **My-Self**
Love is __fucking__ blind
Unbo**trrusive**
## Italic
---
This is *Italic* formate ,do you understand ?
## Bold and Italic
---
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add ***three asterisks*** or ___underscores___ before and after a word or phrase.
Here is a another **_bold_** and *__italic__* format hehe
Here is a another __*bold*__ and _**italic**_ format hehe

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

### Nested Blockquotes

- Profits were higher than ever.

### List
---
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. Its Recommended Way
2. First item
3. Second item
4. Third item
5. Fourth item  

---
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item

### Nested List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
    3. Blaw Blaw Blaw
        1. Hello
        2. Hi
        3. Whats going on?
4. Fourth item


### Unordered Lists
---
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
Unorder List Example:
- Its Recommended Way
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item
***All Are same***
### Nested Unorder List
---
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
        - hi
        - Whats up Guys
        - Its Dillinger Default Document
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

### Adding Elements in Lists
---
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.
*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.
    
*   And here's the third list item.


### Blockquotes
*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

*   And here's the third list item.


### Code
---
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in ``tick`` marks (`).

At the command prompt, type `nano`.
``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

### Codeblocks
---
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

     <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

Without Indent or spaces

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```


```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
### Horizontal Rules
---
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or
underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

### Links
---
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow
it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com))

##### Ading Titles
You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user
hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

### URLs and Email Addresses

To **quickly** turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets
<dr.mdmynuddin@gmail.com>

<https://github.com/Mynuddin-dev>

### Formatting Links
---
To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses.

### Escaping Characters
---
To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash \(\\\) in front of the character.

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

 \=\=
\/\/\\\\
\||
\{ \}
\?
\<\>
\/
\\
\!
\#
\$
\%
\^
\&
\*
\( \)
\+
